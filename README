The gem is based on the work of Thomas Bernard, miniupnp library
(http://miniupnp.free.fr/). The source code and his license can be
found in the ext directory.
The windows version will be made as long as
i have some volounteer that can provide me the precompiled code for
windows. The library is in the module called MiniUPnP, in it you can
find all the library functions.
The module UPnP is a wrapper that simplify the access to the
underlaying library.
The interface was automatically built with swig (http://www.swig.org/),
the interface file is upnp.i
